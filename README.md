## Python and Jupyter Notebook

We assume you have Python installed (we'll use version 3).

It is also useful to install Jupyter Notebook to run interactive Python notebooks. See the installation instructions online: http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

## Tensorflow installation

Vanilla Python or virtualenv (CPU only):
```
pip3 install tensorflow
```

Vanilla Python or virtualenv (GPU, CUDA and CuDNN present):
```
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
```

Anaconda (NVIDIA GPU)
```
conda install tensorflow-gpu
```

Anaconda (no NVIDIA GPU)
```
conda install tensorflow
```
